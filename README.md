# PECF
(Python easy configuration file's)
 
PECF is my config. language for python. It is only developing, so please do not judge strictly. I will be glad of any constructive criticism. PECF is very easy and understood for people. At this stage PECF has no division into int or string but it will be adding in nearest updates.

# Why PECF?

Easy code readability by both human and computer

Speed (Higher than JSON)

Convenience

# About PECF syntaxys
let's compare the PECF syntax with JSON:

PECF: hello: world

JSON: {"hello": "world"}

I think it's obvious that the PECF code is much more readable and more convenient for humans
